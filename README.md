### start the project with CLI

As we are gonna use 'tailwind cli' your project should be a node project.

#### Run this command in the terminal

```
npm init
```

#### Now install tailwind as devDependency

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
```



#### Initialize tailwind / create a tailwind.config.js file

```
npx tailwindcss init
```
